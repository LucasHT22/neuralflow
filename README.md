# NeuralFlow - Neural Network Visualizer
An interactive web-based visualizer that demonstrates how neural networks process data through their layers. Watch as signals flow from input neurons through hidden layers to output neurons with smooth, animated transitions.

V2: Adjustable layers (soon)

V1: Limited layers
